# Emotional AI: A Human-AI Teaming for Emotional Well-being

## Overview

**Project Title:** Emotional AI: A Human-AI Teaming for Emotional Well-being  
**Role:** VIP Research Assistant  
**Duration:** September 2023 - May 2024  
**Institution:** Kennesaw State University, College of Computing and Software Engineering | Marietta, GA

This repository contains the code and documentation related to a research project focused on leveraging Human-AI teaming to enhance mental health evaluation and emotional well-being. The project involves the development and refinement of machine learning algorithms designed to assist in the pre-screening of mental health evaluations through the classification of different emotional causes.

## Project Description

### Objectives

- **Develop Machine Learning Algorithms:** Create algorithms to assist in pre-screenings of mental health evaluations.
- **Categorize Mental Health Issues:** Identify and classify causes of mental health issues into categories such as Bias or Abuse, Career, Medication, Relationship, and Alienation.
- **Enhance Emotional AI:** Improve the accuracy of a neural network model used to classify causes of mental health issues.

### Approach

- **Data Collection:** Utilized data from various subreddits, organized and classified into a comprehensive JSON file.
- **Model Development:** Developed a neural network model using Python and several libraries to classify different mental health issue causes.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Implemented machine learning algorithms using Keras, Sklearn, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Numpy.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieved an initial classification accuracy of around 50%, with ongoing efforts to improve this metric through access to a larger dataset.
